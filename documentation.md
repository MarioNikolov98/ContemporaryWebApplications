## Introduction

A specialised one-page programme called SolentFit Tracker was created to help students at Solent University keep track of their fitness and health. This software was developed in response to the problems that students—especially those in the IT industry—have with leading inactive lives. It is a tool for tracking fitness goals and promoting an active lifestyle.

## Methodology

The creation process of SolentFit Tracker, which used the Design Thinking (DT) methodology, revolved around the human-centric approach. Throughout this iterative process of empathising, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing, the needs of the students were given first priority. The result was a prototype that satisfies the demands of the students for fitness management.

## Methods

Ten students were questioned via Google Forms about their fitness and health challenges as part of the app's validation process. Limits, preferences, exercise regimens, and demographic profiles were all taken into consideration during the app's creation and development process, all of which contributed to effectively handling the challenges that were found.

## Discussion

User testing unveiled significant insights, informing the app's development:

- **Demographic Profiles:** Highlighting the need for a design that appeals to a young, diverse user base.
- **Physical Activity Patterns:** Emphasizing the urgency to address the lack of regular physical activity.
- **Exercise Preferences:** Guiding the app to cater to varied fitness interests.
- **Academic Workload:** Reinforcing the necessity for an efficient and straightforward user experience.
- **Motivational Factors:** Shaping goal-setting features to maintain user engagement.
- **Prior Experience:** Informing the complexity level of the app's functionality.
- **Desired App Features:** Directing foundational features for tracking and goal-setting.

## Implications

The results underscored the importance of:

- **Design and functionality:** Ensuring these meet the expectations of users under 30.
- **Efficiency:** Providing a seamless experience for time-constrained students.
- **Inclusivity:** Accommodating diverse workout preferences.
- **Motivation:** Fostering goal-setting and tracking to sustain user engagement.
- **Community:** Incorporating features to build a sense of connectedness among users.

## Conclusion

By guiding students towards a balanced, healthy lifestyle, the SolentFit Tracker seeks to dramatically enhance their wellbeing. The application's core is encapsulated in this documentation, which also highlights the significance of data-driven development and user-centered design in producing significant digital solutions.
